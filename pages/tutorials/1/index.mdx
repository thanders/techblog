    # Adding a git remote and rebasing your local branch with a remote

    You may often want to work from a fork of another repository and then merge a branch on your fork into that repository. Understanding how synchronize your fork's branch locally with that repository is very helpful.

    This will show you how to create a local git remote and rebase your local branch with a remote branch.

    Rebasing a branch in git means to reapply commits from another branch on top of your local branch. Rebasing is a useful way to update your fork's branch locally if the repostory that it is based on has changed.

    <div style={{ marginTop: '60px' }} />

    ## Adding a git remote

    Git can be used to add a remote branch. Assuming you already have git initialized, you can get started:

    ```bash
    git remote add [remoteName] https://github.com/[username]/[repository].git
    ```

    For example:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/myusername/sample.git
    ```

    <div style={{ marginTop: '60px' }} />

    ## Rebasing local branch with remote

    Fetch updates from the remote branch and rebase the your local branch with the remote

    ```bash
    git fetch [remoteName]
    git rebase [remoteName]/[branchName]
    ```

    For example,
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```

    <div style={{ marginTop: '40px' }} />

    If there is a merge conflict, you will probably want to resolve it.

    Below are some commands that can be used during a merge conflict.

    <div style={{ marginTop: '40px' }} />

    * Continue - When the conflict has been resolved, this will finish the rebase.
      ```bash
      git rebase --continue
      ```

    * Abort - stops the rebase and checks out the original branch
      ```bash
      git rebase --abort
      ```

    * Skip - skips the rebase of the commit that has caused the merge conflict. None of the changes in that commit will be applied.
      ```bash
      git rebase --skip
      ```
